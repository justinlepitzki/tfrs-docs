As our v0.1.0 release is getting close, here is the plan of managing code/branch that I'd like to share with you: we currently have PR219 waiting to merge success-message to develop. After it is done, we'll raise a PR to merge all changes on develop to master and create release-v0.1.0 branch from develop. Richard is working on a few UX-refactor cards(belong to next release), the changes of that will be hold on his own feature branch and won't be merged to develop branch until the release-v0.1.0 branch is created. After release-v0.1.0 branch created, all defects belong to the release need to be committed to it(not develop branch), then will merge it to master branch, then master branch will be deployed on test and prod. Once deployed on prod, a PR will be raised to merge  release-v0.1.0 to develop in order to carry the v0.1.0 defect fixes forward. The code changes for new features(belong to next release) can be merged to develop branch after release-v0.1.0 branch is created but will NOT be merged to master branch until the release-v0.1.0 branch is closed. Let me know if you want to add anything and have any questions.

Once we are officially on prod, the time when there are external clients use it, the hotfix branch may need to be created from master in order to fix the hot defects happen on prod. Other details we can discuss later on. Master branch will be treated as test/production ready branch, all changes will be deployed on test for user acceptance testing, once passed, will deploy on prod.
